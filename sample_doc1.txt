Project Documentation - Part 1

This document contains information about the Canary Datasets project.

The project uses Python and OpenAI APIs to generate conversation logs for evaluating language models. It includes tools for running conversations with various LLM providers and comparing their tool-calling capabilities.

Key features:
- Support for OpenAI-compatible APIs
- Multiple conversation modes (chat_tools, responses, system_prompt)
- Dynamic tool discovery and execution
- Type coercion for function arguments
- Structured JSONL output for analysis

The main scripts are:
- generate.py: Runs conversations and logs results
- score.py: Compares tool calls between different model outputs
- sample_tools.py: Contains all the available tools/functions
- sample_conversations.yaml: Defines conversation scenarios

This project is particularly useful for evaluating how well different language models can handle function calling and tool usage in conversational settings.
